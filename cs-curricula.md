Most apprentice software developers, especially those, who study in colleges, do not know how to develop their skills, and what they should know to work effectively. Surprisingly, everyday usage of products and technologies, invented by other developers and based on well-developed knowledge areas, does not give them an idea how they work, and how they are implemented.

Queueing theory and GSM-based mobile networks; PHP scripts, running at remote servers, transfering generated content through Ethernet using TCP/IP protocol to network cards with NDIS interface on user PCs; CPUs, reordering and speculatively executing instructions to compensate semiconductor electronics limitations on clock rate and light speed; computer-designed cars and planes, drugs and DNA sequenced by computers; computer games, where a tiny patch of reflected light need megabytes of scientific articles full of Fresnel integrals; electronic movies and books; NLP and TreeNet algorithms, retrieving search results from huge databases — these are the things we use every day, that were created by ingenious software developers, by virtue of their fundamental knowledge and talent, and, of course, software development and complexity management methodology, proven over the years.

My friends and I have taken the trouble of preparing a software developers' theoretical minimum based on remarkable IT areas, some parts of which are already included in CS university programmes, the others are taken from interviews and practical experience. Some items require only Wikipedia and take 5 minutes to learn, others would take up months, but this is exactly what you need to know and understand. You are welcome to suggest corrections and additions.
